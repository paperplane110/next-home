While I was jogging, I realized that it's not an easy thing, and it is not something I prefer. I'm only doing it because I want to be healthy and fit.

I'm essentially forcing myself to jog, exerting self-discipline. Isn't just like what I used to do in my working life? I did the work simply because I had to.

However, I then found the key difference: when I'm running despite my laziness, I actually pursuing a higher goal. And most importantly, this higher goal is driven my own will. 

Looking back at my job at Didi, what I did was merely follow boss's will. Even though the OKR was set by myself, it was really just my guess at what my boss wanted me to do; it was not my truly wanted. So, when I was doing those part of job, I just felt resistance, which is why I always felt frustrated at work.

Discipline used to achieve a goal set by my own will is actually freedom.

The discipline required to achieve someone else's goals is the truly form of discipline.
